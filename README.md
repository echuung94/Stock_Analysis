# stock-analysis

## Overview of Project - explain purpose of the analysis 

Steve is wanting to do additional research for his parents and wants to expand the dataset to include the stock 
market over the last few years. The purpose of the analysis was to refactor the original code to loop through all the 
data one time in order to collect the same information in a faster amount of time. In order to accomplish this, Visual Basic 
Application (VBA) in Excel was used to find the total daily volume and return. 

## Results 
Using images and examples of your code, compare the stock performance between 2017 and 2018, 
as well as the execution times of the original script and the refactored script.

## Summary: In a summary statement, address the following questions.

1. What are the advantages or disadvantages of refactoring code?
2. How do these pros and cons apply to refactoring the original VBA script?
